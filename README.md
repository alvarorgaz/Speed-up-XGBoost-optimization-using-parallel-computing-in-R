# Speed-up-XGBoost-optimization-using-parallel-computing-in-R

**Author:**

I am Álvaro Orgaz Expósito, a data science student at KTH (Stockholm, Sweden) and a statistician from UPC-UB (Barcelona, Spain).

**Abstract:** 

This is a short paper for teaching how to speed up your Machine Learning with CPU parallel computing in R. The aim is to learn how to use parallelization package in R for a wide range of computations, but particularly to speed up the grid search or hyperparameters optimization of Machine Learning models such as XGBoost.

**Code:** 

The paper has been developed in R Markdown.
